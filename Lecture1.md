## What is object oriented programming?

OOP is a way to organize your code. It utilizes classes which are templates. Objects are then derived from these classes.
These objects then have data that can be manipulated. Efficiency, reuseability and scalability are the three maiin advantages
of OOP.

## What are the basic concepts of OOP?

## What are the main principles of OOP?

Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is bundling of different types of data that belong together. 
Types of encapsulation: Public, private, protected.

Encapsulation, bundling, data hiding

We use encapsulation for security, data hiding, simplicity and astetchics.


## Abstraction

Abstraction is complex code hidden under one name. For example a "baseballBat" object can have many complex methods to calculate different aspects of the bat. The object is then an abstraction.

In the middle of encapsulation and inheritance.

GUI's are abstractions of code being run in the background. Makes things easier to use. 

Prevents code repition
Improves flexibility
Working in large teams

## Inheritance

Inheritance is when a subclass takes some methods or variables from a parent class. Creates new classes from existing classes.
An object of a subclass is also an instance of the baseclass.

Inheritance reduces code complexity. If there are several subclasses derived from a base class, you only need to change one thing in the base class that affects all subclasses.

Modular codebase - standalone code
Code reuseability
Less development

Refactoring code - change the code to improve readability, but doesnt change output.
clean code - use proper variable name, remove unneeded methods and variables

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism is making subclasses that are slightly different from the parent class. You can make a different subclass without having to change absolutly everything
